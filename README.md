# Bingo
Generation of bingo cards. A single winner per lot generated. 

A vector is defined with the 90 numbers that will then be randomly taken to generate the partitions or batches with which the joins will be generated.
Eg.From here, 5 batches of 17 elements will be randomly assembled to generate a total of 680 tickets that can participate in a draw.
The idea is that this is the base to later be able to configure how the batches are armed, according to the needs of each draw
